# Dakota's Blog

### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

* My first week was exactly what I expected. I knew coming into this that it would be a challenge, and that's what it was from the start. 
* I didn't realize Git/Github/ClI would be so complex, but with practice it is definitely getting easier!

---

### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
* I'm definitely excited to fine tune my skills in the git-flow work strategy, and learn more about how a team works together within a company.
* Best coding practices! 
* Javascript and CSS and their frameworks.
* Developer culture.

### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
* I've spent the last 18 years of my life playing the same video game. (Runescape)
* Me and my fiance have adopted 3 cats in the past 8 months. Look how cute!

### CSS Syntax for button changing color on hover:
```

    background-color: blue;
}
```

### What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
* I wish I could build UI/UX pleasing applications. 
* I wish I could do more of the codewars/leetcode JS problem sets. 

### What are you struggling with?
* The only thing I am really struggling with currently is focusing too much on the end goal. I tend to psych myself out by thinking of all the languages/frameworks we will be learning. I need to just focus more on whats directly in front of me and take it day by day/week by week.

### How do you solve a problem?
* To solve a problem I usually:
    1. Identify the cause of the problem.
    2. Identify possible solutions.
    3. Evaluate and choose the best solution.
    4. Try the solution I chose.
    5. Test and repeat if solution didn't solve the problem correctly. 
    
### What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
* To help myself get unstuck I usually take a breather and step away from my computer.
* Go outside and get some fresh air and try to think through the problem I am facing.

### What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
* I like the comparison of html, css, JS to the purple (css-adjectives) dino(html-nouns) danced(javascript-verbs)
* It's been very intriguing seeing how the 3 work together to render content.

### What are some objects that your blog incorporates?
* As of right now, my blog only contains markdown syntax. It incorporates header elements, lists, images, and a code block.
* I plan on adding html to my blog this weekend, and styling it with css. Hopefully incorporating some javascript at some point to make it dynamic instead of a static page. 

### What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
* I think pseudocoding has been the most cruicial thing we've learned so far. It's really opened my eyes to how a programmer should think. I think the more we work on pseudocode the easier it will become to think through problems logically, and devise a structured plan to any application/project we build throughout the course.

### What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?
* It was very helpful to have the month of basics and being able to still work while learning. The projects, and learning more about pseudocode was the most beneficial part for me. 
### What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
* Time management was really the only thing that hindered me during onboarding.

### How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?
* I had to learn better time management and staying on task. 
* I overcame challenges while learning by taking a breather and thinking through it. 


### What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
* The number one thing that held me back this week was just the change of pace and overthinking. I think I had a bit of imposter syndrome starting off the week, but as the week progressed my confidence got a lot better.

### What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
* I would like to learn more about data structures and algorithms. I know they are very important to thinking like a programmer, and the interview process. I would love to get a better grasp on them, but the morning warmups have definitely been helping.
 
### How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
* In-person bootcamp is much better than remote onboarding for me. It's so much easier to learn in a good enviroment surrounded by like-minded people. 

### What is your “Why”?
* My why is because I have spent the last 4 years since I got out of the military being very self destructive and doing nothing with my life. I had nothing going for me and no plans for the future. I feel like this is my one chance to accomplish something great, and finally have a solid career that I am happy with doing something I really enjoy.
