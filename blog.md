# Dakota's Blog
## **2022-08-24**
My first week was exactly what I expected. I knew coming into this that it would be a challenge, and that's what it was from the start. We started off getting familiar with Git, Github, and the CLI. I'm definitely more excited to fine tune my skills in the git-flow strategy, and learn more about how a team works together within a company. Something about me that can be learned from this blog is I have adopted 3 cats in the past year.
